1. This function uses a combination SCAS and STOS to do its work. First, explain
what is the type of the [EBP+8] and [EBP+C] in line 1 and 8, respectively.
Next, explain what this snippet does.

<pre>
01: 8B 7D 08 mov edi, [ebp+8] -- Loads the content of the address, of the first parameter into edi
02: 8B D7 mov edx, edi -- Backs up edi in edx
03: 33 C0 xor eax, eax -- zeros eax
04: 83 C9 FF or ecx, 0FFFFFFFFh -- sets ecx to -1
05: F2 AE repne scasb -- loops over the string at address [edi] until it finds 0 (reducing ecx each iteration)
06: 83 C1 02 add ecx, 2 -- increases ecx by 2 (effectively makes it -String length not counting null byte)
07: F7 D9 neg ecx -- negates ecx (making it string length)
08: 8A 45 0C mov al, [ebp+0Ch] -- loads the content of the address of the second parameter into al 
09: 8B FA mov edi, edx -- restores edi to the string start
10: F3 AA rep stosb -- overwrite every character in the string with AL, the char which was the second parameter of the function
11: 8B C2 mov eax, edx -- set eax to the start of the string
</pre>

[EBP+8] was a string most likely (SCASB instruction, REPNE for 0)

[EBP+C] was a char most likely (used on [EBP+8], REP STOSB)
